# KittyCatsSampleApp

This is a sample APP, to test and practice my skills. 

This app consists on a fake login view, using Retrofit2 and a mock OAuth server client, and a REST sample using the https://docs.thecatapi.com API to populate a list with all the existing cat breeds. The view allows to filter by breed origin country, and view a detail of the breed when clicking on any of them from the list.

**In this sample app you will find the following implementations:**
 * Dependecy injection using Koin library
 * MVVM architecture
 * API requests using Retrofit2 and a fake local API services
 * Coroutines for background data management
 * Reactive code using LiveData and Transformations
 * RecyclerView and adapter with filter and SwipeRefresh
 * Image loading using Glide library
 * Room library for persistence data
 * App split in different modules
 * Intent navigation with URI
 * Data binding
 * Some unit test using MockK (Mockito)
